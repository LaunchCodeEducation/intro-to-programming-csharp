The C# Language
=======================

.. index:: C#

**C#** is one of many programming languages, each of which serves different purposes.
Programmers can use C# for a variety of projects on different ends of development.  
The ends of development refers to where the code is being used.  

Programmers using C# for web development, means they are building code to run inside a web browser.
*Running inside the browser* means that the code loads at the same time as a
web page and can modify the content. C# can add or remove text, change
colors, produce animations, and react to mouse and keyboard clicks. This makes
the web page *dynamic*---it responds to user actions in real time, and changes
occur without having to refresh the page.

.. index:: ! front end

This cool feature allows immediate updates to your profile when you post a
status, change the color of the “Submit” button after you complete a form,
generate a map when you request directions, or create a sparkly trail that
follows the mouse pointer. All of the changes to what you see on the web page
are part of **front end** development. They are present on your computer.

.. index:: ! Back end

**Back end** development involves passing data between web pages and servers.
C# and Java are considered industry standards for back end languages. 
When you fill out a form online and click "Submit", back end code transfers the 
information you entered to the company
that posted the form. Your information now exists on the company’s servers.

The ins and outs of how the internet works will be covered throughout this
book. While important to understand why we are learning C#, we won’t
quiz you on servers and front end development now!
