.. index:: ! C#, csharp


This course is an introduction to programming and the C# language.  Why C#?  

There are several reasons why C# is a great starting language.  
It is versitle in its applications.  It can be used to create web applications, games, distributed 
and cloud applications, mobile applications, desktop applications, and console applications to 
name a few.  This makes it a well rounded language for almost any type of project.  

C# is designed to be easy to read with practice.  
As a developer, along with writing code, you will be reading code.  Lots of code.  
This could be code for your own project, code shared between you and coworkers, or code you 
find online when troubleshooting an issue.  
As you grow familiar with the vocabulary, functionality, and formatting, your reading speed will 
increase along with your coding speed and confidence. 

Learning a new language can be challenging.  
You might misprouncounce a word, not understand a joke, or even get completely lost trying to read or follow a conversation. 
As you begin coding, this is to be expected.  
Don't let this discourage you, even expereienced developers get stuck.  
Luckily, C# is very well documented.  
Microsoft `Documentation <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/>`__ is where the whys, hows, whens, etc., are written down and explained.  
Think of documentation as a dictionary.  It can be a great resource when you get stuck.
