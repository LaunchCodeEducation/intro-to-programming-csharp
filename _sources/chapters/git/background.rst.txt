What is Git?
============

Git is a **Version Control System (VCS)** and used by many programmers and corporations.

Version Control Systems
-----------------------

A VCS is a system for tracking changes to a code base and storing each version. 
Version control systems keep backups and a revision history of the codebase over time. As the codebase evolves, 
the chances of bugs or broken code increase.  Revision history allows programmers to roll back 
to an earlier bug-free codebase version.  A VCS also enables collaboration between programmers.  
Allowing them to work on different versions of a code base and share their work.

A VCS has a **repository** or storage container for the codebase.
Repositories include the files within the code base, the versions over time, and a log of the changes made.
When a programmer updates the repository, it means they are making a **commit**.
