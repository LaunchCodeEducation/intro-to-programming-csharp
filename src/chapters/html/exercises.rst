Exercises: HTML
===============

**Getting Started:** Create a new HTML project in Visual Studio.  
Refer back to the section on :ref:`How to Create an HTML Project in Visual Studio <creating-html-in-vs>`.

Complete the HTML file for this simple web page. Add lines to your new ``index.html``
that do the following.

1. Add a ``h1`` to the page that says "Why I Love Web Development"
2. Add an ordered list to the page with 3 reasons why you love web development.
3. Add a link to this page below your list.
4. Add a paragraph about the website you want to make with your web development
   superpowers!

This code block gives you a rough outline for how it might look.

.. sourcecode:: html
   :linenos:

   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
      <head>
      </head>
      <body>
         <!-- h1 goes here --->
         <!-- ol goes here --->
         <!-- a goes here --->
         <!-- p goes here --->
      </body>
   </html>

.. admonition:: Note

   Visual Studio has other HTML inside of the ``index.html`` file you will be editing.
   You should only add code, NOT delete!

   In addition, when clicking on your link to make sure it works, right-click
   to open in a new tab!
