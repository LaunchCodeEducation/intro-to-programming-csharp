Both Mac and Windows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have your HTML page created, you are ready to move on to the exercises.

Using the Terminal
--------------------

You can also create the ``index.html`` file using your terminal, 
like we did in the :ref:`Terminal chapter exercises <terminal-ex>`.

Once you have the ``index.html`` file created, you can open in in Visual Studio.

This method will require to provide the necessary HTML code to start any project.
