Create a Repository
-------------------

To get started with a git repository (or "repo" for short), the programmer must first create one.
Let's walkthrough the steps together using the terminal and a text editor.

To create a git repository, you will need to navigate to your project directory using the terminal.
Either select a current directory or make one.  Let's make one called ``homework``.
Once created and you are inside your project directory, we are going to initiate git.

Go ahead and use the command ``git init``, like so:

:: 

   Students-Computer:~ student$ mkdir homework
   Students-Computer:~ student$ cd homework
   Students-Computer:homework student$ git init
      Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/student/homework/.git/

Congrats! You have initialized git version control in this directory.
Now you are ready to code away!

.. index:: ! git commit

Let's add some code or files to this project.  
Since we are using the terminal, let's create a text file by using ``touch my_project.txt``.  
Once that is done, open your new file, type your name, and save your file.

Back in your terminal, type ``git status``.

::

   Students-Computer:homework student$ git status
   On main branch

   No commits yet

   Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include wht will be committed)

         my_project.txt
   
   nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
   Students-Computer:homework student$

You saved your project on your computer, but let's commit it to your Git.  

.. index:: ! rename-branch

.. admonition:: Note

   **A note on the** ``default`` **branch** 

   When using a VCS, the first branch created is your ``default`` branch.  
   On your computer, it is often named the ``master`` branch.  
   Later we will be working with GitHub, which is an online repository that is commonly used when collabotating with others.
   GitHub's default branch is called ``main``.  

   The examples in this chapter will be using ``main`` as the default branch.
   
   If you would like to rename your branch to match, the git command is ``git branch -m NEW-NAME-HERE``.

   ::

      Students-Computer:~ student$ git branch -m main
      Students-Computer:~ student$ git status
      On branch main

Making Commits
--------------

Usually, you will have spent more time coding and saving, and will have a larger amount of code to stage and commit. 
For the sake of our walkthrough, we are going to keep things shorter and simpler.

Earlier we added our first file, ``my_project.txt``, to our ``homework`` directory.  It might be a good time to make a **commit** to your repository.  
A commit is a record of changes you made to your repository.
It allows you to document your progress by creating a time-stamp with a message that you, or others, can reference.
When you look at a timeline of commits, you should be able to see the progress of development.

So when do you make a commit to your repository?

.. pull-quote::

   The general rule of thumb is that any time a significant change in functionality is made, a commit should be made.

If you have created the Git repository and are ready to commit, you can do so by following the commit process.

.. note::

   Git does have a simple commit command, however, making a proper commit requires that you follow a longer procedure than just one command.

.. index:: ! stages of a commit

.. _local-commit:

The Four Stages of Making a ``commit`` 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The procedure for making a commit to a Git repository includes four stages.  

#. ``git status`` gives you information about files that have been changed.  Will also tell you which branch you are currently on.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      Students-Computer:homework student$ git status
      On branch main

      No commits yet

      Untracked files:
         (use "git add <file>..." to include what will be committed)

            my_project.txt

      nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
      Students-Computer:homework student$ git add my_project.txt


#. ``git add`` allows you to add specific or all changed files to a commit.  
   You can type the name of the file or files you want to add to the repo.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      Students-Computer:homework student$ git add my_project.txt


#. ``git commit -m "Your message"`` creates the new commit with the files that you added, 
   with a message describing the changes included in the commit. Here, ``"Your message"`` should be a descriptive message within double-quotes.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      Students-Computer:homework student$ git commit -m "My initial commit"
      [main (root-commit) 7e771d7] My initial commit
      1 file changed, 1 insertion (+)
      create mode 100644 my_project.txt

#. ``git log`` displays a log of every commit in the repository.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      Students-Computer:homework student$ git log
      commit 7e771d788ddfd6080f0a9f10f9aed7105b1a3bcf (HEAD -> main)
      Author: Student <lc101.student@email.com>
      Date:  Wed Apr 24 14:36:53 2019 -0500

If the steps above are followed correctly, you will find your latest commit at the top of the log.

git Tips and Tricks
-------------------

A few other commands that you might find helpful.

* ``git add .`` this command is useful when you have multiple files that you would like to stage for a commit.  This command will add *all* files to that next commit.

* ``clear`` this command is for the terminal.  This will clear all text from your terminal.


Check Your Understanding

.. admonition:: Question

   What git command is NOT a part of the commit process?

   #. ``git add``
   #. ``git log``
   #. ``git status``
   #. ``git push``
