Test-Driven Development
=======================

.. index::
   single: unit testing; TDD

Now that we know more about unit testing, we are going to learn a new way of using them.
Unit testing can easily be added to *existing* code, but what if you could build tests
to verify functionality of code that *doesn't exist yet*.  This may sound
odd, but this process has many benefits as we will learn.

As the name sounds, **Test-driven development (TDD)** is a software development
process where the unit tests are written *first*. However, that doesn't tell the
entire story. Writing the tests first and intentionally thinking more about the
code design leads to better code. The name comes from the idea of the tests
*driving* the development process.

Before we can start using TDD, we need a list of discrete features that can be turned into
unit tests. This will help keep our tests focused on specific functionality which should
lead to code that is easy to read. Along the way we will build confidence as we add features.

.. admonition:: Note

   TDD is a process that some organizations choose to use. Using the TDD
   process is not required when using unit tests.

.. _test-code-cycle:

The Test/Code Cycle
-------------------

With TDD you start with the unit test first. Each test must *clearly describe*
the behavior it is testing.

.. admonition:: Example

   Example test case for our ``Car`` project:

   * We want to verify the number of wheels.  

Because the test is for a feature that does NOT exist *yet*, we need to think
about how the feature will be implemented. This is the time to ask questions
like: *Should we add a new property? What about an entirely new constructor?
Where would this data best work within our code?*

.. admonition:: Example

   How could we implement our test case? Remember we aren't writing the code
   yet, only thinking about the design.


With the design in mind, write the unit test as if the property you imagined *already*
exists. This may seem a bit odd, but considering how the new code will be used
helps find bugs and flaws earlier. We also have to use test utilities such as
``Assert.AreEqual`` to clearly demonstrate that the proposed new code
functions properly.

Next, type out the ideas into an actual test. In this example, the test
references a property that has not been created yet. 
In this instance, the test is expecting an int value of 4.  

.. _red-light:

.. admonition:: Example

   In the **Car class** add the following:

   .. sourcecode:: csharp
      :lineno-start: 10

        public double MilesPerGallon { get; set; }
        public double Odometer { get; set; } = 0;
        public int NumberOfWheels;

        //added property only.  No other code added to this class at this time.


   
   In the **CarTest class**, add the following:

   .. sourcecode:: csharp
      :lineno-start: 20

      [TestMethod]
      public void TestNumberOfWheels()
      {
         Car test_car = new Car("Toyota", "Prius", 10, 50);
         Assert.AreEqual(4, test_car.NumberOfWheels);
      }

   **Note:** We added the property to the Car class, but no code about where it will be used,
   or how it will be implemented yet.  Think of this as a placeholder, 
   that you will update as we move forward.  

Now run the test! The test should fail (or not compile at all) because you have
referenced code that does not exist yet.

.. figure:: figures/red-green-tests.png
      :alt: Graphic of testing output with red 'x' indicating we failed our NumberOfWheels test.

      Failed the ``NumberOfWheels`` test.  Let's refactor our code.


Finally, write code to pass the new test. In the earlier chapters, this is
where you started, but with TDD writing new code is the *last* step.

To make the new test pass, we will need to update our Car class in a few places.
First, we have the property, but how would it used in the program? 
Let's implement this property when we create a Car object.

.. admonition:: Example
   
   In the Car class
      .. sourcecode:: csharp
         :lineno-start: 10 

         public double MilesPerGallon { get; set; }
         public double Odometer { get; set; } = 0;
         public int NumberOfWheels { get; set; }

Now that we have updated the ``Car`` properties, we should look at our constructor.
Add ``NumberOfWheels`` to the constructor.   

.. _green-light:

.. admonition:: Example
   
   In the Car class, added ``numberOfWheels`` to the constructor 
      .. sourcecode:: csharp
         :lineno-start: 13

         public Car(string make, string model, int gasTankSize, double milesPerGallon, int numberOfWheels)
         {
            Make = make;
            Model = model;
            GasTankSize = gasTankSize;
            // Gas tank level defaults to a full tank
            GasTankLevel = gasTankSize;
            MilesPerGallon = milesPerGallon;
            NumberOfWheels = numberOfWheels;  //<-- added NumberOfWheels here
         }

Once you have updated your constructor, you will need to update your Car objects 
by adding an int for number of wheels. 
You will most likely see some red squiggles under your ``new Car`` objects.  



.. admonition:: Example

   .. sourcecode:: csharp
      :lineno-start: 20

      //within the CarTests class

      [TestMethod]
      public void TestNumberOfWheels()
      {
         Car test_car = new Car("Toyota", "Prius", 10, 50, 4);
         Assert.AreEqual(4, test_car.NumberOfWheels);
      }

   *Notice:* The values within the new Car object in line 25.

Now when you run your tests, they should all pass.  Great job!

.. figure:: figures/all-green-tests.png
      :alt: Screenshot of the testing output screen showing all green checks.

      All green!  All tests passed!


Coding this way builds confidence in your work. No matter how large your code
base may get, you know that each part has a test to validate its functionality.

Now that we have one passing test for our Car class, we could
confidently move on to writing tests and code for any other remaining features.
