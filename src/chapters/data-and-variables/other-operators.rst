Other Operators
===============

The String Operator ``+``
--------------------------

.. index::
   pair: string; concatenation

So far we have only seen operators that work on operands which are numeric, but there are operators that work on other data types as well. In particular, the ``+`` operator can be used with ``string`` operands to **concatenate**, or join together two strings.

.. admonition:: Example

   ``"Launch" + "Code"`` evaluates to ``"LaunchCode"``

Let's compare ``+`` used with numbers to ``+`` used with strings.

.. admonition:: Example

   .. sourcecode:: csharp
      :linenos:

      Console.WriteLine(1 + 1);

      Console.WriteLine("1" + "1");

   **Console Output**

   ::

      2
      11

This example demonstrates that **the operator + behaves differently based on the data type of its operands.**

.. warning:: So far we have only seen examples of operators working with data of like type. For the examples ``1 + 1`` and ``"1" + "1"``, both operands are ``number`` and ``string``, respectively. 

   It is possible, however, to mix types with an expression such as ``1 + "1"``. The results of doing so can be unexpected, and at this stage of your coding journey we strongly advise against creating such expressions.

   We will explore such "mixed" operations in a later chapter.

Compound Assignment Operators
-----------------------------

.. index:: ! compound assignment

A common programming task is to update the value of a variable in reference to itself.

.. admonition:: Example

   .. sourcecode:: csharp
      :linenos:

      int x = 1;
      x = x + 1;

      Console.WriteLine(x);

   **Console Output**

   ::

      2

Line 2 may seem odd to you at first, since it uses the value of the variable ``x`` to update ``x`` itself. This technique is not only legal in C# (and programming in general) but is quite common. It essentially says, "update ``x`` to be one more than its current value."

This action is so common, in fact, that it has a shorthand operator, ``+=``. The following example has the same behavior as the one above.

.. admonition:: Example

   .. sourcecode:: js
      :linenos:

      int x = 1;
      x += 1;

      Console.WriteLine(x);

   **Console Output**

   ::

      2

The expression ``x += 1`` is shorthand for ``x = x + 1``.

There is an entire family of such shorthand operators, known as **compound assignment operators**.
