Creating Repos 
==============

Local Repos
-----------

To create a repo on your computer follow these steps:

#. Create a folder to hold your repo and all files.
#. In the terminal use the following command:  ``git init``.
#. As you work on your project, add to your repo and commit your changes periodically.  Here's a :ref:`suggested workflow<git-workflows>`.


Task 2:  Create a Repo on Your Computer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that you have a GitHub account, you are ready to create your first remote repo.

Create a folder on your computer called ``learning-git``.  Initialize it with git using the ``git init`` command.

::

   Students-Computer:~ student$ mkdir learning-git
   Students-Computer:~ student$ cd learning-git
   Students-Computer:~ student$ git init


Task 3:  Create a Remote Repo on GitHub
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open GitHub and create a new repository.  
On the "Create a New Repository" page follow these steps:

#. Call your repo ``learning-git`` so that you can stay organized better.
#. Keep it public for now
#. In the section "Initialize this repository with:" skip this step since we are importing an existing repo.
#. Create repository.
#. Select "...or create a new repository in the command line" option.  Copy the code and paste this into your terminal.
   Note:  If you get a note from git to use a different command, type it into the terminal and hit enter.
#. Refresh your GitHub page and inspect your new repo.
