Assignment #4: HTML Me Something
=================================

You’ve learned a bit of :ref:`HTML <html-index>` and some :ref:`CSS <css-index>`, but you have likely only used
it in bits and pieces so far, adding or modifying content in exercises
or pre-existing files. Here, you are going to take another step forward
by building an entire page from scratch. You will also get some practice
using Git.

There are two parts to this exercise, one focused on HTML and another
focused on CSS. HTML makes up the *structure and content* of web pages,
while CSS dictates the *visual style*.

Best practices dictate that *content* and *style* should be kept as separate as
possible. To that end, we will build the HTML portion of our page first,
and afterwards we will add a few styles with CSS. We do this to avoid using
HTML tags to change the general appearance of our page. For example, what if we
want all of our main headings to be *red*? We can either add this style one
time in the CSS file, or we must include ``style="color:red"`` in EVERY h1 tag.
Especially for large websites, CSS provides the best place to control the
overall appearance of a page.

Sections:
----------

#. :ref:`Getting to Work <getting-to-work>`
#. :ref:`Part 1: HTML <html-me-part1>`
#. :ref:`Part 2: CSS <html-me-part2>`
#. :ref:`Submitting Your Work <submitting-your-work>`


.. _getting-to-work:

Getting to Work
---------------

For this project, we suggest working on it one section at a time.
 
It’s time to build out your page! Dive into each of the two parts below:

#. :ref:`Part 1: HTML <html-me-part1>`

#. :ref:`Part 2: CSS <html-me-part2>`

.. _submitting-your-work:

Submitting your work
--------------------

You will be pushing your final project up to GitHub.

When you are ready to submit, complete the following steps:

Turning In Your Work
---------------------

In Canvas, open the HTML Me Something assignment and click the "Submit" button.
An input box will appear.

Copy the URL for your GitHub repo and paste it into the box, then click
"Submit" again.

Bonus Mission
--------------

If you want to show off your hard work to all your friends, Github has a
cool feature called *Github Pages* that makes this really easy.

Github provides free hosting for any “static” web content (like this
project). All you have to do is change a setting on your GitHub
repository.

#. In a browser, go to the Github page for your repository.
#. Click on the *Settings* tab
#. Scroll down to the *GitHub Pages* section and enable the GitHub Pages
   feature by choosing your ``main`` branch from the dropdown. Hit
   *Save*.

   ``YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/html-me-something`` and see your web page!
